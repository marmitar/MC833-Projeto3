    Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple lockstep File Transfer Protocol which allows a client to get
    a file from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting
    from a local area network. TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement.
