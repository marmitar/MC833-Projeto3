def plot_probs(freq, probs_predicted, label=..., upp_xlim=..., fig=...): # -> Figure:
    """diagnostic plots for comparing two lists of discrete probabilities

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq, probs_predicted : nd_arrays
        two arrays of probabilities, this can be any probabilities for
        the same events, default is designed for comparing predicted
        and observed probabilities
    label : str or tuple
        If string, then it will be used as the label for probs_predicted and
        "freq" is used for the other probabilities.
        If label is a tuple of strings, then the first is they are used as
        label for both probabilities

    upp_xlim : None or int
        If it is not None, then the xlim of the first two plots are set to
        (0, upp_xlim), otherwise the matplotlib default is used
    fig : None or matplotlib figure instance
        If fig is provided, then the axes will be added to it in a (3,1)
        subplots, otherwise a matplotlib figure instance is created

    Returns
    -------
    Figure
        The figure contains 3 subplot with probabilities, cumulative
        probabilities and a PP-plot

    chisquare test for predicted probabilities using cmt-opg

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : results instance
        Instance of a count regression results
    probs : ndarray
        Array of predicted probabilities with observations
        in rows and event counts in columns
    bin_edges : None or array
        intervals to combine several counts into cells
        see combine_bins

    Returns
    -------
    (api not stable, replace by test-results class)
    statistic : float
        chisquare statistic for tes
    p-value : float
        p-value of test
    df : int
        degrees of freedom for chisquare distribution
    extras : ???
        currently returns a tuple with some intermediate results
        (diff, res_aux)

    Notes
    -----

    Status : experimental, no verified unit tests, needs to be generalized
    currently only OPG version with auxiliary regression is implemented

    Assumes counts are np.arange(probs.shape[1]), i.e. consecutive
    integers starting at zero.

    Auxiliary regression drops the last column of binned probs to avoid
    that probabilities sum to 1.

    """Score/LM type tests for Poisson variance assumptions

    Null Hypothesis is

    H0: var(y) = E(y) and assuming E(y) is correctly specified
    H1: var(y) ~= E(y)

    The tests are based on the constrained model, i.e. the Poisson model.
    The tests differ in their assumed alternatives, and in their maintained
    assumptions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results : Poisson results instance
        This can be a results instance for either a discrete Poisson or a GLM
        with family Poisson.
    method : str
        Not used yet. Currently results for all methods are returned.
    _old : bool
        Temporary keyword for backwards compatibility, will be removed
        in future version of statsmodels.

    Returns
    -------
    res : instance
        The instance of DispersionResults has the hypothesis test results,
        statistic, pvalue, method, alternative, as main attributes and a
        summary_frame method that returns the results as pandas DataFrame.

    """score test for zero inflation or deflation in Poisson

    This implements Jansakul and Hinde 2009 score test
    for excess zeros against a zero modified Poisson
    alternative. They use a linear link function for the
    inflation model to allow for zero deflation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    results_poisson: results instance
        The test is only valid if the results instance is a Poisson
        model.
    exog_infl : ndarray
        Explanatory variables for the zero inflated or zero modified
        alternative. I exog_infl is None, then the inflation
        probability is assumed to be constant.

    Returns
    -------
    score test results based on chisquare distribution

    Notes
    -----
    This is a score test based on the null hypothesis that
    the true model is Poisson. It will also reject for
    other deviations from a Poisson model if those affect
    the zero probabilities, e.g. in the direction of
    excess dispersion as in the Negative Binomial
    or Generalized Poisson model.
    Therefore, rejection in this test does not imply that
    zero-inflated Poisson is the appropriate model.

    Status: experimental, no verified unit tests,

    TODO: If the zero modification probability is assumed
    to be constant under the alternative, then we only have
    a scalar test score and we can use one-sided tests to
    distinguish zero inflation and deflation from the
    two-sided deviations. (The general one-sided case is
    difficult.)
    In this case the test specializes to the test by Broek
