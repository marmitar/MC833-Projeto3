class CumIncidenceRight:
    """
    Estimation and inference for a cumulative incidence function.

    If J = 1, 2, ... indicates the event type, the cumulative
    incidence function for cause j is:

    I(t, j) = P(T <= t and J=j)

    Only right censoring is supported.  If frequency weights are provided,
    the point estimate is returned without a standard error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : array_like
        An array of times (censoring times or event times)
    status : array_like
        If status >= 1 indicates which event occurred at time t.  If
        status = 0, the subject was censored at time t.
    title : str
        Optional title used for plots and summary output.
    freq_weights : array_like
        Optional frequency weights
    exog : array_like
        Optional, if present used to account for violation of
        independent censoring.
    bw_factor : float
        Band-width multiplier for kernel-based estimation.  Only
        used if exog is provided.
    dimred : bool
        If True, proportional hazards regression models are used to
        reduce exog to two columns by predicting overall events and
        censoring in two separate models.  If False, exog is used
        directly for calculating kernel weights without dimension
        reduction.

    Attributes
    ----------
    times : array_like
        The distinct times at which the incidence rates are estimated
    cinc : list of arrays
        cinc[k-1] contains the estimated cumulative incidence rates
        for outcome k=1,2,...
    cinc_se : list of arrays
        The standard errors for the values in `cinc`.  Not available when
        exog and/or frequency weights are provided.

    Notes
    -----
    When exog is provided, a local estimate of the cumulative incidence
    rate around each point is provided, and these are averaged to
    produce an estimate of the marginal cumulative incidence
    functions.  The procedure is analogous to that described in Zeng
    (2004) for estimation of the marginal survival function.  The
    approach removes bias resulting from dependent censoring when the
    censoring becomes independent conditioned on the columns of exog.

class SurvfuncRight:
    """
    Estimation and inference for a survival function.

    The survival function S(t) = P(T > t) is the probability that an
    event time T is greater than t.

    This class currently only supports right censoring.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : array_like
        An array of times (censoring times or event times)
    status : array_like
        Status at the event time, status==1 is the 'event'
        (e.g. death, failure), meaning that the event
        occurs at the given value in `time`; status==0
        indicates that censoring has occurred, meaning that
        the event occurs after the given value in `time`.
    entry : array_like, optional An array of entry times for handling
        left truncation (the subject is not in the risk set on or
        before the entry time)
    title : str
        Optional title used for plots and summary output.
    freq_weights : array_like
        Optional frequency weights
    exog : array_like
        Optional, if present used to account for violation of
        independent censoring.
    bw_factor : float
        Band-width multiplier for kernel-based estimation.  Only used
        if exog is provided.

    Attributes
    ----------
    surv_prob : array_like
        The estimated value of the survivor function at each time
        point in `surv_times`.
    surv_prob_se : array_like
        The standard errors for the values in `surv_prob`.  Not available
        if exog is provided.
    surv_times : array_like
        The points where the survival function changes.
    n_risk : array_like
        The number of subjects at risk just before each time value in
        `surv_times`.  Not available if exog is provided.
    n_events : array_like
        The number of events (e.g. deaths) that occur at each point
        in `surv_times`.  Not available if exog is provided.

    Notes
    -----
    If exog is None, the standard Kaplan-Meier estimator is used.  If
    exog is not None, a local estimate of the marginal survival
    function around each point is constructed, and these are then
    averaged.  This procedure gives an estimate of the marginal
    survival function that accounts for dependent censoring as long as
    the censoring becomes independent when conditioning on the
    covariates in exog.  See Zeng et al. (2004) for details.
