"""Statistical power, solving for nobs, ... - trial version

Created on Sat Jan 12 21:48:06 2013

Author: Josef Perktold

Example
roundtrip - root with respect to all variables

       calculated, desired
nobs   33.367204205 33.367204205
effect 0.5 0.5
alpha  0.05 0.05
power   0.8 0.8


TODO:
refactoring
 - rename beta -> power,    beta (type 2 error is beta = 1-power)  DONE
 - I think the current implementation can handle any kinds of extra keywords
   (except for maybe raising meaningful exceptions
 - streamline code, I think internally classes can be merged
   how to extend to k-sample tests?
   user interface for different tests that map to the same (internal) test class
 - sequence of arguments might be inconsistent,
   arg and/or kwds so python checks what's required and what can be None.
 - templating for docstrings ?

    Parameters
    ----------
    diff : float
        difference in the estimated means or statistics under the alternative.
    power : float in interval (0,1)
        power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a type II

    Notes
    -----
    changed in 0.14: use df2, df1 instead of df_num, df_denom as arg names.
    The latter had reversed meaning.

    The sample size is given implicitly by ``df2`` with fixed number of
    constraints given by numerator degrees of freedom ``df1``:

        nobs = df2 + df1 + ncc

    Set ncc=0 to match t-test, or f-test in LikelihoodModelResults.
    ncc=1 matches the non-centrality parameter in R::pwr::pwr.f2.test

    ftest_power with ncc=0 should also be correct for f_test in regression

            number of observations of sample 1. The number of observations of

            error, that is wrong rejections if the Null Hypothesis is true.
        ratio : float
            ratio of the number of observations in sample 2 relative to

        power : float
            Power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
            type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly

            significance level, e.g. 0.05, is the probability of a type I
            error, that is wrong rejections if the Null Hypothesis is true.
        power : float in interval (0,1)
            power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
            type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly
            rejects the Null Hypothesis if the Alternative Hypothesis is true.
        n_bins : int
            number of bins or cells in the distribution

        Returns
        -------
        value : float
            The value of the parameter that was set to None in the call. The
            value solves the power equation given the remaining parameters.


        Notes
        -----
        The function uses scipy.optimize for finding the value that satisfies
        the power equation. It first uses ``brentq`` with a prior search for
        bounds. If this fails to find a root, ``fsolve`` is used. If ``fsolve``
        also fails, then, for ``alpha``, ``power`` and ``effect_size``,
        ``brentq`` with fixed bounds is used. However, there can still be cases
        where this fails.

        Parameters
        ----------
        effect_size : float
            standardize effect size, difference between the two means divided
            by the standard deviation. effect size has to be positive.
        nobs1 : int or float
            number of observations of sample 1. The number of observations of
            sample two is ratio times the size of sample 1,
            i.e. ``nobs2 = nobs1 * ratio``
        alpha : float in interval (0,1)
            significance level, e.g. 0.05, is the probability of a type I
            error, that is wrong rejections if the Null Hypothesis is true.
        ratio : float
            ratio of the number of observations in sample 2 relative to
            sample 1. see description of nobs1
            The default for ratio is 1; to solve for ration given the other
            arguments it has to be explicitely set to None.
        alternative : str, 'two-sided' (default) or 'one-sided'
            extra argument to choose whether the power is calculated for a
            two-sided (default) or one sided test.
            'one-sided' assumes we are in the relevant tail.

        Returns
        -------
        power : float
            Power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
            type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly
            rejects the Null Hypothesis if the Alternative Hypothesis is true.
