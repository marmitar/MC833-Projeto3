class NonlinearDeltaCov:
    '''Asymptotic covariance by Deltamethod

    The function is designed for 2d array, with rows equal to
    the number of equations or constraints and columns equal to the number
    of parameters. 1d params work by chance ?

    fun: R^{m*k) -> R^{m}  where m is number of equations and k is
    the number of parameters.

    equations follow Greene

    This class does not use any caching. The intended usage is as a helper
    function. Extra methods have been added for convenience but might move
    to calling functions.

    The naming in this class uses params for the original random variable, and
    cov_params for it's covariance matrix. However, this class is independent
    of the use cases in support of the models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable, f(params)
        Nonlinear function of the estimation parameters. The return of
        the function can be vector valued, i.e. a 1-D array.
    params : ndarray
        Parameters at which function `func` is evaluated.
    cov_params : ndarray
        Covariance matrix of the parameters `params`.
    deriv : function or None
        First derivative or Jacobian of func. If deriv is None, then a
        numerical derivative will be used. If func returns a 1-D array,
        then the `deriv` should have rows corresponding to the elements
        of the return of func.
    func_args : None
        Not yet implemented.

        Parameters
        ----------
        params : None or ndarray
            Values at which gradient is evaluated. If params is None, then
            the attached params are used.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : float, optional
            The significance level for the confidence interval.
            ie., The default `alpha` = .05 returns a 95% confidence interval.
        use_t : boolean
            If use_t is False (default), then the normal distribution is used
            for the confidence interval, otherwise the t distribution with
            `df` degrees of freedom is used.
        df : int or float
            degrees of freedom for t distribution. Only used and required if
            use_t is True.
        var_extra : None or array_like float
            Additional variance that is added to the variance based on the
            delta method. This can be used to obtain confidence intervalls for
            new observations (prediction interval).
        predicted : ndarray (float)
            Predicted value, can be used to avoid repeated calculations if it
            is already available.
        se : ndarray (float)
            Standard error, can be used to avoid repeated calculations if it

        conf_int : array
            Each row contains [lower, upper] limits of the confidence interval
