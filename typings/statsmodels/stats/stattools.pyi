def durbin_watson(resids, axis=...): # -> Any:
    r"""
    Calculates the Durbin-Watson statistic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resids : array_like
        Data for which to compute the Durbin-Watson statistic. Usually
        regression model residuals.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis to use if data has more than 1 dimension. Default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    dw : float, array_like
        The Durbin-Watson statistic.

    Notes
    -----
    The null hypothesis of the test is that there is no serial correlation
    in the residuals.
    The Durbin-Watson test statistic is defined as:

    .. math::

       \sum_{t=2}^T((e_t - e_{t-1})^2)/\sum_{t=1}^Te_t^2

    The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where ``r`` is the
    sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Thus, for r == 0, indicating no
    serial correlation, the test statistic equals 2. This statistic will
    always be between 0 and 4. The closer to 0 the statistic, the more
    evidence for positive serial correlation. The closer to 4, the more
    evidence for negative serial correlation.

def jarque_bera(resids, axis=...): # -> tuple[Any, ndarray[_AnyShape, dtype[Any]] | ndarray[tuple[()], dtype[Any]], Any, Any]:
    r"""
    The Jarque-Bera test of normality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resids : array_like
        Data to test for normality. Usually regression model residuals that
        are mean 0.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis to use if data has more than 1 dimension. Default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    JB : {float, ndarray}
        The Jarque-Bera test statistic.
    JBpv : {float, ndarray}
        The pvalue of the test statistic.
    skew : {float, ndarray}
        Estimated skewness of the data.
    kurtosis : {float, ndarray}
        Estimated kurtosis of the data.

    Notes
    -----
    Each output returned has 1 dimension fewer than data

    The Jarque-Bera test statistic tests the null that the data is normally
    distributed against an alternative that the data follow some other
    distribution. The test statistic is based on two moments of the data,
    the skewness, and the kurtosis, and has an asymptotic :math:`\chi^2_2`
    distribution.

    The test statistic is defined

    .. math:: JB = n(S^2/6+(K-3)^2/24)

    where n is the number of data points, S is the sample skewness, and K is
    the sample kurtosis of the data.
