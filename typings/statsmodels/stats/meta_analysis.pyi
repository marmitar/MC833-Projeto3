    Status: API is experimental, Options for zero handling is incomplete.

    The statistics are defined as:

    Notes
    -----
    Status: Basic functionality is verified, mainly compared to R metafor
    package. However, API might still change.

    This computes both fixed effects and random effects estimates. The
    random effects results depend on the method to estimate the RE variance.

    Scale estimate
    In fixed effects models and in random effects models without fully
    iterated random effects variance, the model will in general not account
    for all residual variance. Traditional meta-analysis uses a fixed
    scale equal to 1, that might not produce test statistics and
    confidence intervals with the correct size. Estimating the scale to account
    for residual variance often improves the small sample properties of
    inference and confidence intervals.
    This adjustment to the standard errors is often referred to as HKSJ
    method based attributed to Hartung and Knapp and Sidik and Jonkman.
    However, this is equivalent to estimating the scale in WLS.
    The results instance includes both, fixed scale and estimated scale
    versions of standard errors and confidence intervals.
