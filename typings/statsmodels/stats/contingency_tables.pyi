Methods for analyzing two-way contingency tables (i.e. frequency
tables for observations that are cross-classified with respect to two
categorical variables).

The main classes are:

  * Table : implements methods that can be applied to any two-way
  contingency table.

  * SquareTable : implements methods that can be applied to a square
  two-way contingency table.

  * Table2x2 : implements methods that can be applied to a 2x2
  contingency table.

  * StratifiedTable : implements methods that can be applied to a
  collection of 2x2 contingency tables.

Also contains functions for conducting McNemar's test and Cochran's q
test.

Note that the inference procedures may depend on how the data were
sampled.  In general the observed units are independent and
identically distributed.

                degrees of freedom of the chisquare distribution

        Notes
        -----
        The implementation is based on the SAS documentation. R includes
        it in `mcnemar.test` if the table is not 2 by 2.  However a more
        direct generalization of the McNemar test to larger tables is
        provided by the homogeneity test (TableSymmetry.homogeneity).

        The p-value is based on the chi-square distribution which requires
        that the sample size is not very small to be a good approximation
        of the true distribution. For 2x2 contingency tables the exact
        distribution can be obtained with `mcnemar`

        Notes
        -----
        For a 2x2 table this is equivalent to McNemar's test.  More
        generally the procedure tests the null hypothesis that the
        marginal distribution of the row factor is equal to the
        marginal distribution of the column factor.  For this to be

def mcnemar(table, exact=..., correction=...): # -> _Bunch:
    """
    McNemar test of homogeneity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : array_like
        A square contingency table.
    exact : bool
        If exact is true, then the binomial distribution will be used.
        If exact is false, then the chisquare distribution will be
        used, which is the approximation to the distribution of the
        test statistic for large sample sizes.
    correction : bool
        If true, then a continuity correction is used for the chisquare
        distribution (if exact is false.)

    Returns
    -------
    A bunch with attributes:

    statistic : float or int, array
        The test statistic is the chisquare statistic if exact is
        false. If the exact binomial distribution is used, then this
        contains the min(n1, n2), where n1, n2 are cases that are zero
        in one sample but one in the other sample.
    pvalue : float or array
        p-value of the null hypothesis of equal marginal distributions.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a special case of Cochran's Q test, and of the homogeneity
    test. The results when the chisquare distribution is used are
    identical, except for continuity correction.

def cochrans_q(x, return_object=...): # -> _Bunch | tuple[Any, ndarray[_AnyShape, dtype[Any]] | ndarray[tuple[()], dtype[Any]], Any]:
    """
    Cochran's Q test for identical binomial proportions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, 2d (N, k)
        data with N cases and k variables
    return_object : bool
        Return values as bunch instead of as individual values.

    Returns
    -------
    Returns a bunch containing the following attributes, or the
    individual values according to the value of `return_object`.

    statistic : float
       test statistic
    pvalue : float
       pvalue from the chisquare distribution

    Notes
    -----
    Cochran's Q is a k-sample extension of the McNemar test. If there
    are only two groups, then Cochran's Q test and the McNemar test
    are equivalent.

    The procedure tests that the probability of success is the same
    for every group.  The alternative hypothesis is that at least two
    groups have a different probability of success.

    In Wikipedia terminology, rows are blocks and columns are
    treatments.  The number of rows N, should be large for the
    chisquare distribution to be a good approximation.

    The Null hypothesis of the test is that all treatments have the
    same effect.
