    '''convert raw data with shape (subject, rater) to (subject, cat_counts)

    brings data into correct format for fleiss_kappa

    bincount will raise exception if data cannot be converted to integer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like, 2-Dim
        data containing category assignment with subjects in rows and raters
        in columns.
    n_cat : None or int
        If None, then the data is converted to integer categories,
        0,1,2,...,n_cat-1. Because of the relabeling only category levels
        with non-zero counts are included.
        If this is an integer, then the category levels in the data are already
        assumed to be in integers, 0,1,2,...,n_cat-1. In this case, the
        returned array may contain columns with zero count, if no subject
        has been categorized with this level.

    Returns
    -------
    arr : nd_array, (n_rows, n_cat)
        Contains counts of raters that assigned a category level to individuals.
        Subjects are in rows, category levels in columns.
    categories : nd_array, (n_category_levels,)
        Contains the category levels.

    '''convert raw data with shape (subject, rater) to (rater1, rater2)

    brings data into correct format for cohens_kappa

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like, 2-Dim
        data containing category assignment with subjects in rows and raters
        in columns.
    bins : None, int or tuple of array_like
        If None, then the data is converted to integer categories,
        0,1,2,...,n_cat-1. Because of the relabeling only category levels
        with non-zero counts are included.
        If this is an integer, then the category levels in the data are already
        assumed to be in integers, 0,1,2,...,n_cat-1. In this case, the
        returned array may contain columns with zero count, if no subject
        has been categorized with this level.
        If bins are a tuple of two array_like, then the bins are directly used
        by ``numpy.histogramdd``. This is useful if we want to merge categories.

    Returns
    -------
    arr : nd_array, (n_cat, n_cat)
        Contingency table that contains counts of category level with rater1
        in rows and rater2 in columns.

    Notes
    -----
    no NaN handling, delete rows with missing values

    This works also for more than two raters. In that case the dimension of
    the resulting contingency table is the same as the number of raters
    instead of 2-dimensional.

def fleiss_kappa(table, method=...): # -> Any:
    """Fleiss' and Randolph's kappa multi-rater agreement measure

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : array_like, 2-D
        assumes subjects in rows, and categories in columns. Convert raw data
        into this format by using
        :func:`statsmodels.stats.inter_rater.aggregate_raters`
    method : str
        Method 'fleiss' returns Fleiss' kappa which uses the sample margin
        to define the chance outcome.
        Method 'randolph' or 'uniform' (only first 4 letters are needed)
        returns Randolph's (2005) multirater kappa which assumes a uniform
        distribution of the categories to define the chance outcome.

    Returns
    -------
    kappa : float
        Fleiss's or Randolph's kappa statistic for inter rater agreement

    Notes
    -----
    no variance or hypothesis tests yet

    Interrater agreement measures like Fleiss's kappa measure agreement relative
    to chance agreement. Different authors have proposed ways of defining
    these chance agreements. Fleiss' is based on the marginal sample distribution
    of categories, while Randolph uses a uniform distribution of categories as
    benchmark. Warrens (2010) showed that Randolph's kappa is always larger or
    equal to Fleiss' kappa. Under some commonly observed condition, Fleiss' and
    Randolph's kappa provide lower and upper bounds for two similar kappa_like
    measures by Light (1971) and Hubert (1977).

def cohens_kappa(table, weights=..., return_results=..., wt=...): # -> KappaResults | Any:
    '''Compute Cohen's kappa with variance and equal-zero test

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : array_like, 2-Dim
        square array with results of two raters, one rater in rows, second
        rater in columns
    weights : array_like
        The interpretation of weights depends on the wt argument.
        If both are None, then the simple kappa is computed.
        see wt for the case when wt is not None
        If weights is two dimensional, then it is directly used as a weight
        matrix. For computing the variance of kappa, the maximum of the
        weights is assumed to be smaller or equal to one.
        TODO: fix conflicting definitions in the 2-Dim case for
    wt : {None, str}
        If wt and weights are None, then the simple kappa is computed.
        If wt is given, but weights is None, then the weights are set to
        be [0, 1, 2, ..., k].
        If weights is a one-dimensional array, then it is used to construct
        the weight matrix given the following options.

        wt in ['linear', 'ca' or None] : use linear weights, Cicchetti-Allison
            actual weights are linear in the score "weights" difference
        wt in ['quadratic', 'fc'] : use linear weights, Fleiss-Cohen
            actual weights are squared in the score "weights" difference
        wt = 'toeplitz' : weight matrix is constructed as a toeplitz matrix
            from the one dimensional weights.

    return_results : bool
        If True (default), then an instance of KappaResults is returned.
        If False, then only kappa is computed and returned.

    Returns
    -------
    results or kappa
        If return_results is True (default), then a results instance with all
        statistics is returned
        If return_results is False, then only kappa is calculated and returned.

    Notes
    -----
    There are two conflicting definitions of the weight matrix, Wikipedia
    versus SAS manual. However, the computation are invariant to rescaling
    of the weights matrix, so there is no difference in the results.

    Weights for 'linear' and 'quadratic' are interpreted as scores for the
    categories, the weights in the computation are based on the pairwise
    difference between the scores.
    Weights for 'toeplitz' are a interpreted as weighted distance. The distance
    only depends on how many levels apart two entries in the table are but
    not on the levels themselves.

    example:

    weights = '0, 1, 2, 3' and wt is either linear or toeplitz means that the
    weighting only depends on the simple distance of levels.

    weights = '0, 0, 1, 1' and wt = 'linear' means that the first two levels
    are zero distance apart and the same for the last two levels. This is
    the sample as forming two aggregated levels by merging the first two and
    the last two levels, respectively.

    weights = [0, 1, 2, 3] and wt = 'quadratic' is the same as squaring these
    weights and using wt = 'toeplitz'.
