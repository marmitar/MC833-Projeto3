def test_poisson(count, nobs, value, method=..., alternative=..., dispersion=...): # -> HolderTuple:
    """Test for one sample poisson mean or rate

    Parameters
    ----------
    count : array_like
        Observed count, number of events.
    nobs : arrat_like
        Currently this is total exposure time of the count variable.
        This will likely change.
    value : float, array_like
        This is the value of poisson rate under the null hypothesis.
    method : str
        Method to use for confidence interval.
        This is required, there is currently no default method.
        See Notes for available methods.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'smaller', 'larger'}
        alternative hypothesis, which can be two-sided or either one of the
        one-sided tests.
    dispersion : float
        Dispersion scale coefficient for Poisson QMLE. Default is that the
        data follows a Poisson distribution. Dispersion different from 1
        correspond to excess-dispersion in Poisson quasi-likelihood (GLM).
        Dispersion coeffficient different from one is currently only used in
        wald and score method.

    Returns
    -------
    HolderTuple instance with test statistic, pvalue and other attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementatio of the hypothesis test is mainly based on the references
    for the confidence interval, see confint_poisson.

    Available methods are:

    - "score" : based on score test, uses variance under null value
    - "wald" : based on wald test, uses variance base on estimated rate.
    - "waldccv" : based on wald test with 0.5 count added to variance
      computation. This does not use continuity correction for the center of
      the confidence interval.
    - "exact-c" central confidence interval based on gamma distribution
    - "midp-c" : based on midp correction of central exact confidence interval.
      this uses numerical inversion of the test function. not vectorized.
    - "sqrt" : based on square root transformed counts
    - "sqrt-a" based on Anscombe square root transformation of counts + 3/8.

def confint_poisson(count, exposure, method=..., alpha=...): # -> tuple[Any, Any]:
    """Confidence interval for a Poisson mean or rate

    The function is vectorized for all methods except "midp-c", which uses
    an iterative method to invert the hypothesis test function.

    All current methods are central, that is the probability of each tail is
    smaller or equal to alpha / 2. The one-sided interval limits can be
    obtained by doubling alpha.

    Parameters
    ----------
    count : array_like
        Observed count, number of events.
    exposure : arrat_like
        Currently this is total exposure time of the count variable.

    alpha : float in (0, 1)

    Returns
    -------
    tuple (low, upp) : confidence limits.

    Notes
    -----
    Methods are mainly based on Barker (2002) [1]_ and Swift (2009) [3]_.

    Available methods are:

    - "exact-c" central confidence interval based on gamma distribution
    - "score" : based on score test, uses variance under null value
    - "wald" : based on wald test, uses variance base on estimated rate.
    - "waldccv" : based on wald test with 0.5 count added to variance
      computation. This does not use continuity correction for the center of
      the confidence interval.
    - "midp-c" : based on midp correction of central exact confidence interval.
      this uses numerical inversion of the test function. not vectorized.
    - "jeffreys" : based on Jeffreys' prior. computed using gamma distribution
    - "sqrt" : based on square root transformed counts
    - "sqrt-a" based on Anscombe square root transformation of counts + 3/8.
    - "sqrt-centcc" will likely be dropped. anscombe with continuity corrected
      center.
      (Similar to R survival cipoisson, but without the 3/8 right shift of
      the confidence interval).

    sqrt-cent is the same as sqrt-a, using a different computation, will be
    deleted.

    sqrt-v is a corrected square root method attributed to vandenbrouke, which
    might also be deleted.

    Todo:

    - missing dispersion,
    - maybe split nobs and exposure (? needed in NB). Exposure could be used
      to standardize rate.
    - modified wald, switch method if count=0.

    The size of the test is the sum of the two one-tailed tests, which
    corresponds to an equal-tailed two-sided test.
    If low and upp are equal, then the result is the same as the standard
    two-sided test.

    The p-value is computed as `2 * min(pvalue_low, pvalue_upp)` in analogy to

    Parameters
    ----------
    count1 : int
        Number of events in first sample.
    exposure1 : float
        Total exposure (time * subjects) in first sample.
    count2 : int
        Number of events in second sample.
    exposure2 : float
        Total exposure (time * subjects) in second sample.
    method : string
        Method for the test statistic and the p-value. Defaults to `'score'`.
        see Notes.

        ratio:

        - 'wald': NOT YET, method W1A, wald test, variance based on observed
          rates
        - 'waldcc' :
        - 'score': method W2A, score test, variance based on estimate under
          the Null hypothesis
        - 'wald-log': W3A, uses log-ratio, variance based on observed rates
        - 'score-log' W4A, uses log-ratio, variance based on estimate under
          the Null hypothesis
        - 'sqrt': W5A, based on variance stabilizing square root transformation
        - 'sqrtcc' :
        - 'exact-cond': NOT YET, exact conditional test based on binomial
          distribution
          This uses ``binom_test`` which is minlike in the two-sided case.

        diff:

    compare : {'diff', 'ratio'}
        Default is "ratio".
        If compare is `diff`, then the hypothesis test is for
        diff = rate1 - rate2.
        If compare is `ratio`, then the hypothesis test is for the
        rate ratio defined by ratio = rate1 / rate2.
    alternative : string
        The alternative hypothesis, H1, has to be one of the following

        - 'two-sided': H1: ratio of rates is not equal to ratio_null (default)
        - 'larger' :   H1: ratio of rates is larger than ratio_null
        - 'smaller' :  H1: ratio of rates is smaller than ratio_null

    alpha : float in (0, 1)
        Significance level, nominal coverage of the confidence interval is
        1 - alpha.
