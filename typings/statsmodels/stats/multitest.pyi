    Test results and p-value correction for multiple tests

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvals : array_like, 1-d
        uncorrected p-values.   Must be 1-dimensional.
    alpha : float
        FWER, family-wise error rate, e.g. 0.1
    method : str
        Method used for testing and adjustment of pvalues. Can be either the
        full name or initial letters. Available methods are:

        - `bonferroni` : one-step correction
        - `sidak` : one-step correction
        - `holm-sidak` : step down method using Sidak adjustments
        - `holm` : step-down method using Bonferroni adjustments
        - `simes-hochberg` : step-up method  (independent)
        - `hommel` : closed method based on Simes tests (non-negative)
        - `fdr_bh` : Benjamini/Hochberg  (non-negative)
        - `fdr_by` : Benjamini/Yekutieli (negative)
        - `fdr_tsbh` : two stage fdr correction (non-negative)
        - `fdr_tsbky` : two stage fdr correction (non-negative)

    maxiter : int or bool
        Maximum number of iterations for two-stage fdr, `fdr_tsbh` and
        `fdr_tsbky`. It is ignored by all other methods.
        maxiter=1 (default) corresponds to the two stage method.
        maxiter=-1 corresponds to full iterations which is maxiter=len(pvals).
        maxiter=0 uses only a single stage fdr correction using a 'bh' or 'bky'
        prior fraction of assumed true hypotheses.
    is_sorted : bool
        If False (default), the p_values will be sorted, but the corrected
        pvalues are in the original order. If True, then it assumed that the
        pvalues are already sorted in ascending order.
    returnsorted : bool
         not tested, return sorted p-values instead of original sequence

    Returns
    -------
    reject : ndarray, boolean
        true for hypothesis that can be rejected for given alpha
    pvals_corrected : ndarray
        p-values corrected for multiple tests
    alphacSidak : float
        corrected alpha for Sidak method
    alphacBonf : float
        corrected alpha for Bonferroni method

    Notes
    -----
    There may be API changes for this function in the future.

    Except for 'fdr_twostage', the p-value correction is independent of the
    alpha specified as argument. In these cases the corrected p-values
    can also be compared with a different alpha. In the case of 'fdr_twostage',
    the corrected p-values are specific to the given alpha, see
    ``fdrcorrection_twostage``.

    The 'fdr_gbs' procedure is not verified against another package, p-values
    are derived from scratch and are not derived in the reference. In Monte
    Carlo experiments the method worked correctly and maintained the false
    discovery rate.

    All procedures that are included, control FWER or FDR in the independent
    case, and most are robust in the positively correlated case.

    `fdr_gbs`: high power, fdr control for independent case and only small
    violation in positively correlated case

    **Timing**:

    Most of the time with large arrays is spent in `argsort`. When
    we want to calculate the p-value for several methods, then it is more
    efficient to presort the pvalues, and put the results back into the
    original order outside of the function.

    Method='hommel' is very slow for large arrays, since it requires the
    evaluation of n partitions, where n is the number of p-values.

def fdrcorrection(pvals, alpha=..., method=..., is_sorted=...): # -> tuple[NDArray[numpy.bool[builtins.bool]], ndarray[_AnyShape, dtype[Any]]]:
    '''
    pvalue correction for false discovery rate.

    This covers Benjamini/Hochberg for independent or positively correlated and
    Benjamini/Yekutieli for general or negatively correlated tests.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvals : array_like, 1d
        Set of p-values of the individual tests.
    alpha : float, optional
        Family-wise error rate. Defaults to ``0.05``.
    method : {'i', 'indep', 'p', 'poscorr', 'n', 'negcorr'}, optional
        Which method to use for FDR correction.
        ``{'i', 'indep', 'p', 'poscorr'}`` all refer to ``fdr_bh``
        (Benjamini/Hochberg for independent or positively
        correlated tests). ``{'n', 'negcorr'}`` both refer to ``fdr_by``
        (Benjamini/Yekutieli for general or negatively correlated tests).
        Defaults to ``'indep'``.
    is_sorted : bool, optional
        If False (default), the p_values will be sorted, but the corrected
        pvalues are in the original order. If True, then it assumed that the
        pvalues are already sorted in ascending order.

    Returns
    -------
    rejected : ndarray, bool
        True if a hypothesis is rejected, False if not
    pvalue-corrected : ndarray
        pvalues adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing to limit FDR

    Notes
    -----
    If there is prior information on the fraction of true hypothesis, then alpha
    should be set to ``alpha * m/m_0`` where m is the number of tests,
    given by the p-values, and m_0 is an estimate of the true hypothesis.
    (see Benjamini, Krieger and Yekuteli)

    The two-step method of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutiel that estimates the number
    of false hypotheses will be available (soon).

    Both methods exposed via this function (Benjamini/Hochberg, Benjamini/Yekutieli)
    are also available in the function ``multipletests``, as ``method="fdr_bh"`` and
    ``method="fdr_by"``, respectively.

    '''(iterated) two stage linear step-up procedure with estimation of number of true
    hypotheses

    Benjamini, Krieger and Yekuteli, procedure in Definition 6

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvals : array_like
        set of p-values of the individual tests.
    alpha : float
        error rate
    method : {'bky', 'bh')
        see Notes for details

        * 'bky' - implements the procedure in Definition 6 of Benjamini, Krieger
           and Yekuteli 2006
        * 'bh' - the two stage method of Benjamini and Hochberg

    maxiter : int or bool
        Maximum number of iterations.
        maxiter=1 (default) corresponds to the two stage method.
        maxiter=-1 corresponds to full iterations which is maxiter=len(pvals).
        maxiter=0 uses only a single stage fdr correction using a 'bh' or 'bky'
        prior fraction of assumed true hypotheses.
        Boolean maxiter is allowed for backwards compatibility with the
        deprecated ``iter`` keyword.
        maxiter=False is two-stage fdr (maxiter=1)
        maxiter=True is full iteration (maxiter=-1 or maxiter=len(pvals))

        .. versionadded:: 0.14

            Replacement for ``iter`` with additional features.

    iter : bool
        ``iter`` is deprecated use ``maxiter`` instead.
        If iter is True, then only one iteration step is used, this is the
        two-step method.
        If iter is False, then iterations are stopped at convergence which
        occurs in a finite number of steps (at most len(pvals) steps).

        .. deprecated:: 0.14

            Use ``maxiter`` instead of ``iter``.

    Returns
    -------
    rejected : ndarray, bool
        True if a hypothesis is rejected, False if not
    pvalue-corrected : ndarray
        pvalues adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing to limit FDR
    m0 : int
        ntest - rej, estimated number of true (not rejected) hypotheses
    alpha_stages : list of floats
        A list of alphas that have been used at each stage

    Notes
    -----
    The returned corrected p-values are specific to the given alpha, they
    cannot be used for a different alpha.

    The returned corrected p-values are from the last stage of the fdr_bh
    linear step-up procedure (fdrcorrection0 with method='indep') corrected
    for the estimated fraction of true hypotheses.
    This means that the rejection decision can be obtained with
    ``pval_corrected <= alpha``, where ``alpha`` is the original significance
    level.
    (Note: This has changed from earlier versions (<0.5.0) of statsmodels.)

    BKY described several other multi-stage methods, which would be easy to implement.
    However, in their simulation the simple two-stage method (with iter=False) was the
    most robust to the presence of positive correlation
