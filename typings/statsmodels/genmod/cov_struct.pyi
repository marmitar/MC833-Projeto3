           The expected value of endog for each observed value in the

        Some dependence structures do not use `expval` and/or `index`

        projected to the nearest such matrix.  These projection events
        are recorded in the fit_history attribute of the GEE model.

        Systems of linear equations with the covariance matrix as the
        left hand side (LHS) are solved for different right hand sides
        (RHS); the LHS is only factorized once to save time.

class Nested(CovStruct):

    A nested working dependence structure.

    A nested working dependence structure captures unique variance
    associated with each level in a hierarchy of partitions of the
    cases.  For each level of the hierarchy, there is a set of iid
    random effects with mean zero, and with variance that is specific
    to the level.  These variance parameters are estimated from the
    data using the method of moments.

    The top level of the hierarchy is always defined by the required
    `groups` argument to GEE.

    The `dep_data` argument used to create the GEE defines the
    remaining levels of the hierarchy.  it should be either an array,
    or if using the formula interface, a string that contains a
    formula.  If an array, it should contain a `n_obs x k` matrix of
    labels, corresponding to the k levels of partitioning that are
    nested under the top-level `groups` of the GEE instance.  These
    subgroups should be nested from left to right, so that two
    observations with the same label for column j of `dep_data` should
    also have the same label for all columns j' < j (this only applies
    to observations in the same top-level cluster given by the
    `groups` argument to GEE).

    If `dep_data` is a formula, it should usually be of the form `0 +
    a + b + ...`, where `a`, `b`, etc. contain labels defining group
    membership.  The `0 + ` should be included to prevent creation of
    an intercept.  The variable values are interpreted as labels for
    group membership, but the variables should not be explicitly coded
    as categorical, i.e. use `0 + a` not `0 + C(a)`.

    Notes

    The calculations for the nested structure involve all pairs of
    observations within the top level `group` passed to GEE.  Large

class Autoregressive(CovStruct):
    """
    A first-order autoregressive working dependence structure.

    The dependence is defined in terms of the `time` component of the
    parent GEE class, which defaults to the index position of each
    value within its cluster, based on the order of values in the
    input data set.  Time represents a potentially multidimensional
    index from which distances between pairs of observations can be
    determined.

    The correlation between two observations in the same cluster is
    dep_params^distance, where `dep_params` contains the (scalar)
    autocorrelation parameter to be estimated, and `distance` is the
    distance between the two observations, calculated from their
    corresponding time values.  `time` is stored as an n_obs x k
    matrix, where `k` represents the number of dimensions in the time
    index.

    The autocorrelation parameter is estimated using weighted
    nonlinear least squares, regressing each value within a cluster on
    each preceding value in the same cluster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist_func : function from R^k x R^k to R^+, optional
        A function that computes the distance between the two
        observations based on their `time` values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pairs : dict-like
      A dictionary of dictionaries, where `pairs[group][label]`
      provides the indices of all pairs of observations in the group
      that have the same covariance value.  Specifically,
      `pairs[group][label]` is a tuple `(j1, j2)`, where `j1` and `j2`
      are integer arrays of the same length.  `j1[i], j2[i]` is one
      index pair that belongs to the `label` equivalence class.  Only
      one triangle of each covariance matrix should be included.
      Positions where j1 and j2 have the same value are variance
      parameters.
    labels : array_like
      An array of labels such that every distinct pair of labels
      defines an equivalence class.  Either `labels` or `pairs` must
      be provided.  When the two labels in a pair are equal two
      equivalence classes are defined: one for the diagonal elements
      (corresponding to variances) and one for the off-diagonal
      elements (corresponding to covariances).
    return_cov : bool
      If True, `covariance_matrix` returns an estimate of the
      covariance matrix, otherwise returns an estimate of the
      correlation matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    Using `labels` to define the class is much easier than using
    `pairs`, but is less general.

    Any pair of values not contained in `pairs` will be assigned zero
    covariance.

    The index values in `pairs` are row indices into the `exog`
    matrix.  They are not updated if missing data are present.  When
    using this covariance structure, missing data should be removed
    before constructing the model.

    If using `labels`, after a model is defined using the covariance
    structure it is possible to remove a label pair from the second
    level of the `pairs` dictionary to force the corresponding
    covariance to be zero.

    Examples
    --------
    The following sets up the `pairs` dictionary for a model with two
    groups, equal variance for all observations, and constant
    covariance for all pairs of observations within each group.
