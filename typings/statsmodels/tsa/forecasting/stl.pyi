    Model-based forecasting using STL to remove seasonality

    Forecasts are produced by first subtracting the seasonality
    estimated using STL, then forecasting the deseasonalized
    data using a time-series model, for example, ARIMA.

    Parameters
    ----------
%(stl_forecast_params)s

    See Also
    --------
    statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA
        ARIMA modeling.
    statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoReg
        Autoregressive modeling supporting complex deterministics.
    statsmodels.tsa.exponential_smoothing.ets.ETSModel
        Additive and multiplicative exponential smoothing with trend.
    statsmodels.tsa.statespace.exponential_smoothing.ExponentialSmoothing
        Additive exponential smoothing with trend.

    Notes
    -----
    If :math:`\hat{S}_t` is the seasonal component, then the deseasonalize
    series is constructed as

    .. math::

        Y_t - \hat{S}_t

    The trend component is not removed, and so the time series model should
    be capable of adequately fitting and forecasting the trend if present. The
    out-of-sample forecasts of the seasonal component are produced as

    .. math::

        \hat{S}_{T + h} = \hat{S}_{T - k}

    where :math:`k = m - h + m \lfloor (h-1)/m \rfloor` tracks the period
    offset in the full cycle of 1, 2, ..., m where m is the period length.

    This class is mostly a convenience wrapper around ``STL`` and a
    user-specified model. The model is assumed to follow the standard
    statsmodels pattern:

    * ``fit`` is used to estimate parameters and returns a results instance,
      ``results``.
    * ``results`` must exposes a method ``forecast(steps, **kwargs)`` that
      produces out-of-sample forecasts.
    * ``results`` may also exposes a method ``get_prediction`` that produces
      both in- and out-of-sample predictions.

    See the notebook `Seasonal Decomposition
    <../examples/notebooks/generated/stl_decomposition.html>`__ for an
    overview.

    Examples

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> from statsmodels.tsa.api import STLForecast
    >>> from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
    >>> from statsmodels.datasets import macrodata

    >>> data = np.log(ds.data.m1)
    >>> base_date = f"{int(ds.data.year[0])}-{3*int(ds.data.quarter[0])+1}-1"
    >>> data.index = pd.date_range(base_date, periods=data.shape[0], freq="QS")

    Generate forecasts from an ARIMA

    >>> stlf = STLForecast(data, ARIMA, model_kwargs={"order": (2, 1, 0)})
    >>> res = stlf.fit()
    >>> forecasts = res.forecast(12)

    Generate forecasts from an Exponential Smoothing model with trend

    >>> from statsmodels.tsa.statespace import exponential_smoothing
    >>> ES = exponential_smoothing.ExponentialSmoothing
    >>> config = {"trend": True}
    >>> stlf = STLForecast(data, ES, model_kwargs=config)
    >>> res = stlf.fit()
    >>> forecasts = res.forecast(12)
