    Dynamic factor model

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        The observed time-series process :math:`y`
    exog : array_like, optional
        Array of exogenous regressors for the observation equation, shaped
        nobs x k_exog.
    k_factors : int
        The number of unobserved factors.
    factor_order : int
        The order of the vector autoregression followed by the factors.
    error_cov_type : {'scalar', 'diagonal', 'unstructured'}, optional
        The structure of the covariance matrix of the observation error term,
        where "unstructured" puts no restrictions on the matrix, "diagonal"
        requires it to be any diagonal matrix (uncorrelated errors), and
        "scalar" requires it to be a scalar times the identity matrix. Default
        is "diagonal".
    error_order : int, optional
        The order of the vector autoregression followed by the observation
        error component. Default is None, corresponding to white noise errors.
    error_var : bool, optional
        Whether or not to model the errors jointly via a vector autoregression,
        rather than as individual autoregressions. Has no effect unless
        `error_order` is set. Default is False.
    enforce_stationarity : bool, optional
        Whether or not to transform the AR parameters to enforce stationarity
        in the autoregressive component of the model. Default is True.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments may be used to provide default values for state space
        matrices or for Kalman filtering options. See `Representation`, and

        in the autoregressive component of the model. Default is True.

    Notes
    -----
    The dynamic factor model considered here is in the so-called static form,
    and is specified:

    .. math::

        y_t & = \Lambda f_t + B x_t + u_t \\
        f_t & = A_1 f_{t-1} + \dots + A_p f_{t-p} + \eta_t \\
        u_t & = C_1 u_{t-1} + \dots + C_q u_{t-q} + \varepsilon_t

    where there are `k_endog` observed series and `k_factors` unobserved
    factors. Thus :math:`y_t` is a `k_endog` x 1 vector and :math:`f_t` is a
    `k_factors` x 1 vector.

    :math:`x_t` are optional exogenous vectors, shaped `k_exog` x 1.

    :math:`\eta_t` and :math:`\varepsilon_t` are white noise error terms. In
    order to identify the factors, :math:`Var(\eta_t) = I`. Denote
    :math:`Var(\varepsilon_t) \equiv \Sigma`.

    Options related to the unobserved factors:

    - `k_factors`: this is the dimension of the vector :math:`f_t`, above.
      To exclude factors completely, set `k_factors = 0`.
    - `factor_order`: this is the number of lags to include in the factor
      evolution equation, and corresponds to :math:`p`, above. To have static
      factors, set `factor_order = 0`.

    Options related to the observation error term :math:`u_t`:

    - `error_order`: the number of lags to include in the error evolution
      equation; corresponds to :math:`q`, above. To have white noise errors,
      set `error_order = 0` (this is the default).
    - `error_cov_type`: this controls the form of the covariance matrix
      :math:`\Sigma`. If it is "dscalar", then :math:`\Sigma = \sigma^2 I`. If
      it is "diagonal", then
      :math:`\Sigma = \text{diag}(\sigma_1^2, \dots, \sigma_n^2)`. If it is
      "unstructured", then :math:`\Sigma` is any valid variance / covariance
      matrix (i.e. symmetric and positive definite).
    - `error_var`: this controls whether or not the errors evolve jointly
      according to a VAR(q), or individually according to separate AR(q)
      processes. In terms of the formulation above, if `error_var = False`,
      then the matrices :math:C_i` are diagonal, otherwise they are general
      VAR matrices.

        Parameters
        ----------
        params : array_like

        Returns
        -------
        params : array_like
            Array of parameters.

        Notes
        -----
        Let `n = k_endog`, `m = k_factors`, and `p = factor_order`. Then the
        `params` vector has length
        :math:`[n \times m] + [n] + [m^2 \times p]`.
        It is expanded in the following way:

        - The first :math:`n \times m` parameters fill out the factor loading
          matrix, starting from the [0,0] entry and then proceeding along rows.
          These parameters are not modified in `transform_params`.
        - The next :math:`n` parameters provide variances for the error_cov
          errors in the observation equation. They fill in the diagonal of the
          observation covariance matrix, and are constrained to be positive by
          `transofrm_params`.
        - The next :math:`m^2 \times p` parameters are used to create the `p`
          coefficient matrices for the vector autoregression describing the
          factor transition. They are transformed in `transform_params` to
          enforce stationarity of the VAR(p). They are placed so as to make
          the transition matrix a companion matrix for the VAR. In particular,
          we assume that the first :math:`m^2` parameters fill the first
          coefficient matrix (starting at [0,0] and filling along rows), the
          second :math:`m^2` parameters fill the second matrix, etc.

        Notes
        -----
        Although it can be difficult to interpret the estimated factor loadings
        and factors, it is often helpful to use the coefficients of
        determination from univariate regressions to assess the importance of
        each factor in explaining the variation in each endogenous variable.

        In models with many variables and factors, this can sometimes lend
        interpretation to the factors (for example sometimes one factor will
        load primarily on real variables and another on nominal variables).
