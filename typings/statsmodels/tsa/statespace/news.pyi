    Impacts of data revisions and news on estimates of variables of interest

    Parameters
    ----------
    news_results : SimpleNamespace instance
        Results from `KalmanSmoother.news`.
    model : MLEResults
        The results object associated with the model from which the NewsResults
        was generated.
    updated : MLEResults
        The results object associated with the model containing the updated
        dataset.
    previous : MLEResults
        The results object associated with the model containing the previous
        dataset.
    impacted_variable : str, list, array, or slice, optional
        Observation variable label or slice of labels specifying particular
        impacted variables to display in output. The impacted variable(s)
        describe the variables that were *affected* by the news. If you do not
        know the labels for the variables, check the `endog_names` attribute of
        the model instance.

        any impact less than 1e-10 is assumed to be zero.

        This table decomposes updated forecasts of variables of interest from

        This table does not summarize the impacts or show the effect of

        This form of the details table is organized so that the impacted
        dates / variables are first in the index. This is convenient for
        slicing by impacted variables / dates to view the details of data
        updates for a particular variable or date.

        However, since the `forecast (prev)` and `observed` columns have a lot
        of duplication, printing the entire table gives a result that is less
        easy to parse than that produced by the `details_by_update` property.
        `details_by_update` contains the same information but is organized to
        be more convenient for displaying the entire table of detailed updates.
        At the same time, `details_by_update` is less convenient for

        show_revisions_columns : bool, optional
            If set to False, the impacts table will not show the impacts from
            data revisions or the total impacts. Default is to show the

        Returns
        -------
        details_table : SimpleTable or list of SimpleTable
            Table or list of tables describing how the news from each update
            (i.e. news from a particular variable / date) translates into
            changes to the forecasts of each impacted variable variable / date.

            This table contains information about the updates and about the
            impacts. Updates are newly observed datapoints that were not
            available in the previous results set. Each update leads to news,
            and the news may cause changes in the forecasts of the impacted
            variables. The amount that a particular piece of news (from an
            update to some variable at some date) impacts a variable at some
            date depends on weights that can be computed from the model
            results.

            The data contained in this table that refer to updates are:

            - `update date` : The date at which a new datapoint was added.
            - `updated variable` : The variable for which a new datapoint was
              added.
            - `forecast (prev)` : The value that had been forecast by the
              previous model for the given updated variable and date.
            - `observed` : The observed value of the new datapoint.
            - `news` : The news is the difference between the observed value
              and the previously forecast value for a given updated variable
              and date.

            The data contained in this table that refer to impacts are:

            - `impact date` : A date associated with an impact.
            - `impacted variable` : A variable that was impacted by the news.
            - `weight` : The weight of news from a given `update date` and
              `update variable` on a given `impacted variable` at a given
              `impact date`.
            - `impact` : The revision to the smoothed estimate / forecast of
              the impacted variable at the impact date based specifically on
              the news generated by the `updated variable` at the
              `update date`.
