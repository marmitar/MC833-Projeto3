class MLEModel(tsbase.TimeSeriesModel):
    r"""
    State space model for maximum likelihood estimation

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        The observed time-series process :math:`y`
    k_states : int
        The dimension of the unobserved state process.
    exog : array_like, optional
        Array of exogenous regressors, shaped nobs x k. Default is no
        exogenous regressors.
    dates : array_like of datetime, optional
        An array-like object of datetime objects. If a Pandas object is given
        for endog, it is assumed to have a DateIndex.
    freq : str, optional
        The frequency of the time-series. A Pandas offset or 'B', 'D', 'W',
        'M', 'A', or 'Q'. This is optional if dates are given.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments may be used to provide default values for state space
        matrices or for Kalman filtering options. See `Representation`, and
        `KalmanFilter` for more details.

    Notes
    -----
    This class wraps the state space model with Kalman filtering to add in
    functionality for maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, it adds
    the concept of updating the state space representation based on a defined
    set of parameters, through the `update` method or `updater` attribute (see
    below for more details on which to use when), and it adds a `fit` method
    which uses a numerical optimizer to select the parameters that maximize
    the likelihood of the model.

    The `start_params` `update` method must be overridden in the
    child class (and the `transform` and `untransform` methods, if needed).

        Fits the model by maximum likelihood via Kalman filter.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start_params : array_like, optional
            Initial guess of the solution for the loglikelihood maximization.
            If None, the default is given by Model.start_params.
        transformed : bool, optional
            Whether or not `start_params` is already transformed. Default is
            True.
        includes_fixed : bool, optional
            If parameters were previously fixed with the `fix_params` method,
            this argument describes whether or not `start_params` also includes
            the fixed parameters, in addition to the free parameters. Default
            is False.
        cov_type : str, optional
            The `cov_type` keyword governs the method for calculating the
            covariance matrix of parameter estimates. Can be one of:

            - 'opg' for the outer product of gradient estimator
            - 'oim' for the observed information matrix estimator, calculated
              using the method of Harvey (1989)
            - 'approx' for the observed information matrix estimator,
              calculated using a numerical approximation of the Hessian matrix.
            - 'robust' for an approximate (quasi-maximum likelihood) covariance
              matrix that may be valid even in the presence of some
              misspecifications. Intermediate calculations use the 'oim'
              method.
            - 'robust_approx' is the same as 'robust' except that the
              intermediate calculations use the 'approx' method.
            - 'none' for no covariance matrix calculation.

            Default is 'opg' unless memory conservation is used to avoid
            computing the loglikelihood values for each observation, in which
            case the default is 'approx'.
        cov_kwds : dict or None, optional
            A dictionary of arguments affecting covariance matrix computation.

            **opg, oim, approx, robust, robust_approx**

            - 'approx_complex_step' : bool, optional - If True, numerical
              approximations are computed using complex-step methods. If False,
              numerical approximations are computed using finite difference
              methods. Default is True.
            - 'approx_centered' : bool, optional - If True, numerical
              approximations computed using finite difference methods use a
              centered approximation. Default is False.
        method : str, optional
            The `method` determines which solver from `scipy.optimize`
            is used, and it can be chosen from among the following strings:

            - 'newton' for Newton-Raphson
            - 'nm' for Nelder-Mead
            - 'bfgs' for Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
            - 'lbfgs' for limited-memory BFGS with optional box constraints
            - 'powell' for modified Powell's method
            - 'cg' for conjugate gradient
            - 'ncg' for Newton-conjugate gradient
            - 'basinhopping' for global basin-hopping solver

            The explicit arguments in `fit` are passed to the solver,
            with the exception of the basin-hopping solver. Each
            solver has several optional arguments that are not the same across
            solvers. See the notes section below (or scipy.optimize) for the
            available arguments and for the list of explicit arguments that the
            basin-hopping solver supports.
        maxiter : int, optional
            The maximum number of iterations to perform.
        full_output : bool, optional
            Set to True to have all available output in the Results object's
            mle_retvals attribute. The output is dependent on the solver.
            See LikelihoodModelResults notes section for more information.
        disp : bool, optional
            Set to True to print convergence messages.
        callback : callable callback(xk), optional
            Called after each iteration, as callback(xk), where xk is the
            current parameter vector.
        return_params : bool, optional
            Whether or not to return only the array of maximizing parameters.
            Default is False.
        optim_score : {'harvey', 'approx'} or None, optional
            The method by which the score vector is calculated. 'harvey' uses
            the method from Harvey (1989), 'approx' uses either finite
            difference or complex step differentiation depending upon the
            value of `optim_complex_step`, and None uses the built-in gradient
            approximation of the optimizer. Default is None. This keyword is
            only relevant if the optimization method uses the score.
        optim_complex_step : bool, optional
            Whether or not to use complex step differentiation when
            approximating the score; if False, finite difference approximation
            is used. Default is True. This keyword is only relevant if
            `optim_score` is set to 'harvey' or 'approx'.
        optim_hessian : {'opg', 'oim', 'approx'}, optional
            The method by which the Hessian is numerically approximated. 'opg'
            uses outer product of gradients, 'oim' uses the information
            matrix formula from Harvey (1989), and 'approx' uses numerical
            approximation. This keyword is only relevant if the
            optimization method uses the Hessian matrix.
        low_memory : bool, optional
            If set to True, techniques are applied to substantially reduce
            memory usage. If used, some features of the results object will
            not be available (including smoothed results and in-sample
            prediction), although out-of-sample forecasting is possible.
            Default is False.
        **kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments to pass to the optimizer.

        This method is from Harvey (1989), which shows that the information
        matrix only depends on terms from the gradient. This implementation is
        partially analytic and partially numeric approximation, therefore,
        because it uses the analytic formula for the information matrix, with
        numerically computed elements of the gradient.

            same as in the state space model.
        state_shocks : array_like, optional
            If specified, these are the shocks to the state equation,
            :math:`\eta_t`. If unspecified, these are automatically
            generated using a pseudo-random number generator. If specified,
            must be shaped `nsimulations` x `k_posdef` where `k_posdef` is the
            same as in the state space model.
        initial_state : array_like, optional
            If specified, this is the initial state vector to use in
            simulation, which should be shaped (`k_states` x 1), where
            `k_states` is the same as in the state space model. If unspecified,
            but the model has been initialized, then that initialization is
            used. This must be specified if `anchor` is anything other than
            "start" or 0 (or else you can use the `simulate` method on a
            results object rather than on the model object).
        anchor : int, str, or datetime, optional
            First period for simulation. The simulation will be conditional on
            all existing datapoints prior to the `anchor`.  Type depends on the
            index of the given `endog` in the model. Two special cases are the
            strings 'start' and 'end'. `start` refers to beginning the
            simulation at the first period of the sample, and `end` refers to
            beginning the simulation at the first period after the sample.
            Integer values can run from 0 to `nobs`, or can be negative to
            apply negative indexing. Finally, if a date/time index was provided
            to the model, then this argument can be a date string to parse or a
            datetime type. Default is 'start'.
        repetitions : int, optional
            Number of simulated paths to generate. Default is 1 simulated path.
        exog : array_like, optional
            New observations of exogenous regressors, if applicable.
        transformed : bool, optional
            Whether or not `params` is already transformed. Default is
            True.
        includes_fixed : bool, optional
            If parameters were previously fixed with the `fix_params` method,
            this argument describes whether or not `params` also includes
            the fixed parameters, in addition to the free parameters. Default
            is False.
        pretransformed_measurement_shocks : bool, optional
            If `measurement_shocks` is provided, this flag indicates whether it
            should be directly used as the shocks. If False, then it is assumed
            to contain draws from the standard Normal distribution that must be
            transformed using the `obs_cov` covariance matrix. Default is True.
        pretransformed_state_shocks : bool, optional
            If `state_shocks` is provided, this flag indicates whether it
            should be directly used as the shocks. If False, then it is assumed
            to contain draws from the standard Normal distribution that must be
            transformed using the `state_cov` covariance matrix. Default is
            True.
        pretransformed_initial_state : bool, optional
            If `initial_state` is provided, this flag indicates whether it

            If `seed` is None (or `np.random`), the
            class:``~numpy.random.RandomState`` singleton is used.
            If `seed` is an int, a new class:``~numpy.random.RandomState``
            instance is used, seeded with `seed`.
            If `seed` is already a class:``~numpy.random.Generator`` or

            (nsimulations x k_endog x repetitions). If the model was given
            Pandas input then the output will be a Pandas object. If
            `k_endog > 1` and `repetitions` is not None, then the output will

            The information criteria to compute.
        method : {'standard', 'lutkepohl'}

        Notes
        -----
        The `'standard'` formulas are:

        .. math::

            AIC & = -2 \log L(Y_n | \hat \psi) + 2 k \\
            BIC & = -2 \log L(Y_n | \hat \psi) + k \log n \\
            HQIC & = -2 \log L(Y_n | \hat \psi) + 2 k \log \log n \\

        where :math:`\hat \psi` are the maximum likelihood estimates of the
        parameters, :math:`n` is the number of observations, and `k` is the
        number of estimated parameters.

        Note that the `'standard'` formulas are returned from the `aic`, `bic`,
        and `hqic` results attributes.

        The `'lutkepohl'` formulas are (Lütkepohl, 2010):

        .. math::

            AIC_L & = \log | Q | + \frac{2 k}{n} \\
            BIC_L & = \log | Q | + \frac{k \log n}{n} \\
            HQIC_L & = \log | Q | + \frac{2 k \log \log n}{n} \\

        where :math:`Q` is the state covariance matrix. Note that the Lütkepohl
        definitions do not apply to all state space models, and should be used
        with care outside of SARIMAX and VARMAX models.

        Test for heteroskedasticity of standardized residuals

        Tests whether the sum-of-squares in the first third of the sample is
        significantly different than the sum-of-squares in the last third
        of the sample. Analogous to a Goldfeld-Quandt test. The null hypothesis
        is of no heteroskedasticity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : {'breakvar', None}
            The statistical test for heteroskedasticity. Must be 'breakvar'
            for test of a break in the variance. If None, an attempt is
            made to select an appropriate test.
        alternative : str, 'increasing', 'decreasing' or 'two-sided'
            This specifies the alternative for the p-value calculation. Default
            is two-sided.
        use_f : bool, optional
            Whether or not to compare against the asymptotic distribution

            an array of size 2 corresponding to the first endogenous variable,

        The null hypothesis is of no heteroskedasticity.

        For :math:`h = [T/3]`, the test statistic is:

        .. math::

            H(h) = \sum_{t=T-h+1}^T  \tilde v_t^2
            \Bigg / \sum_{t=d+1}^{d+1+h} \tilde v_t^2

        where :math:`d` = max(loglikelihood_burn, nobs_diffuse)` (usually
        corresponding to diffuse initialization under either the approximate
        or exact approach).

        This statistic can be tested against an :math:`F(h,h)` distribution.
        Alternatively, :math:`h H(h)` is asymptotically distributed according
        to :math:`\chi_h^2`; this second test can be applied by passing
        `use_f=True` as an argument.

            Zero-indexed observation number at which to end forecasting, i.e.,
            the last forecast is end. Can also be a date string to
            parse or a datetime type. However, if the dates index does not
            have a fixed frequency, end must be an integer index if you

            Prior to this observation, true endogenous values will be used for
            prediction; starting with this observation and continuing through

            instead.
        information_set : str, optional
            The information set to condition each prediction on. Default is
            "predicted", which computes predictions of period t values
            conditional on observed data through period t-1; these are
            one-step-ahead predictions, and correspond with the typical

            observed data through period t, and "smoothed", which computes
            predictions of period t values conditional on the entire dataset
            (including also future observations t+1, t+2, ...).
        signal_only : bool, optional
            Whether to compute predictions of only the "signal" component of
            the observation equation. Default is False. For example, the

            datetime type (these are not interpreted as offsets).
            Prior to this observation, true endogenous values will be used for
            prediction; starting with this observation and continuing through
            the end of prediction, forecasted endogenous values will be used
            instead.
        information_set : str, optional
            The information set to condition each prediction on. Default is
            "predicted", which computes predictions of period t values
            conditional on observed data through period t-1; these are
            one-step-ahead predictions, and correspond with the typical
            `fittedvalues` results attribute. Alternatives are "filtered",
            which computes predictions of period t values conditional on
            observed data through period t, and "smoothed", which computes
            predictions of period t values conditional on the entire dataset
            (including also future observations t+1, t+2, ...).
        signal_only : bool, optional
            Whether to compute predictions of only the "signal" component of
            the observation equation. Default is False. For example, the
            observation equation of a time-invariant model is
            :math:`y_t = d + Z \alpha_t + \varepsilon_t`, and the "signal"
            component is then :math:`Z \alpha_t`. If this argument is set to
            True, then predictions of the "signal" :math:`Z \alpha_t` will be
            returned. Otherwise, the default is for predictions of :math:`y_t`
            to be returned.

            Additional arguments may be required for forecasting beyond the end
            of the sample. See ``FilterResults.predict`` for more details.

        anchor : int, str, or datetime, optional
            Starting point from which to begin the simulations; type depends on

            strings 'start' and 'end', which refer to starting at the beginning

        ----------
        steps : int, optional
            The number of steps for which impulse responses are calculated.
            Default is 1. Note that for time-invariant models, the initial
            impulse is not counted as a step, so if `steps=1`, the output will
            have 2 entries.
        impulse : int, str or array_like
            If an integer, the state innovation to pulse; must be between 0
            and `k_posdef-1`. If a str, it indicates which column of df
            the unit (1) impulse is given.
            Alternatively, a custom impulse vector may be provided; must be
            shaped `k_posdef x 1`.
        orthogonalized : bool, optional
            Whether or not to perform impulse using orthogonalized innovations.
            Note that this will also affect custum `impulse` vectors. Default
            is False.
        cumulative : bool, optional
            Whether or not to return cumulative impulse responses. Default is
            False.
        anchor : int, str, or datetime, optional
            Time point within the sample for the state innovation impulse. Type
            depends on the index of the given `endog` in the model. Two special
            cases are the strings 'start' and 'end', which refer to setting the
            impulse at the first and last points of the sample, respectively.
            Integer values can run from 0 to `nobs - 1`, or can be negative to
            apply negative indexing. Finally, if a date/time index was provided
            to the model, then this argument can be a date string to parse or a
            datetime type. Default is 'start'.
        exog : array_like, optional
            New observations of exogenous regressors, if applicable.
        **kwargs
            If the model has time-varying design or transition matrices and the
            combination of `anchor` and `steps` implies creating impulse
            responses for the out-of-sample period, then these matrices must
            have updated values provided for the out-of-sample steps. For
            example, if `design` is a time-varying component, `nobs` is 10,
            `anchor=1`, and `steps` is 15, a (`k_endog` x `k_states` x 7)
            matrix must be provided with the new design matrix values.

        impulse_responses : ndarray
            Responses for each endogenous variable due to the impulse
            given by the `impulse` argument. For a time-invariant model, the
            impulse responses are given for `steps + 1` elements (this gives
            the "initial impulse" followed by `steps` responses for the
            important cases of VAR and SARIMAX models), while for time-varying
            models the impulse responses are only given for `steps` elements

            matrices).

            This denotes whether the `comparison` argument represents a

            impacts are computed for all revisions, while if set to False, all
            revisions are grouped together. Default is False. Note that for
            large models, setting this to be near the beginning of the sample
            can cause this function to be slow.
        state_index : array_like, optional
            An optional index specifying a subset of states to use when
            constructing the impacts of revisions and news. For example, if

        Recreate the results object with new data appended to the original data

        Creates a new result object applied to a dataset that is created by
        appending new data to the end of the model's original data. The new
        results can then be used for analysis or forecasting.

        Parameters
        ----------
        endog : array_like
            New observations from the modeled time-series process.
        exog : array_like, optional
            New observations of exogenous regressors, if applicable.
        refit : bool, optional
            Whether to re-fit the parameters, based on the combined dataset.
            Default is False (so parameters from the current results object
            are used to create the new results object).
        copy_initialization : bool, optional
            Whether or not to copy the initialization from the current results
            set to the new model. Default is False
        fit_kwargs : dict, optional
            Keyword arguments to pass to `fit` (if `refit=True`) or `filter` /
            `smooth`.
        copy_initialization : bool, optional
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments may be used to modify model specification
            arguments when created the new model object.

        Returns
        -------
        results
            Updated Results object, that includes results from both the
            original dataset and the new dataset.

        Notes
        -----
        The `endog` and `exog` arguments to this method must be formatted in
        the same way (e.g. Pandas Series versus Numpy array) as were the
        `endog` and `exog` arrays passed to the original model.

        The `endog` argument to this method should consist of new observations
        that occurred directly after the last element of `endog`. For any other
        kind of dataset, see the `apply` method.

        This method will apply filtering to all of the original data as well
        as to the new data. To apply filtering only to the new data (which
        can be much faster if the original dataset is large), see the `extend`
        method.

            If given, subplots are created in this figure instead of in a new

            figure using `fig.add_subplot()`.
        figsize : tuple, optional
            If a figure is created, this argument allows specifying a size.
            The tuple is (width, height).
        auto_ylims : bool, optional
            If True, adjusts automatically the y-axis limits to ACF values.
        bartlett_confint : bool, default True
            Confidence intervals for ACF values are generally placed at 2
            standard errors around r_k. The formula used for standard error
            depends upon the situation. If the autocorrelations are being used
            to test for randomness of residuals as part of the ARIMA routine,
            the standard errors are determined assuming the residuals are white
            noise. The approximate formula for any lag is that standard error
            of each r_k = 1/sqrt(N). See section 9.4 of [1] for more details on
            the 1/sqrt(N) result. For more elementary discussion, see section
            5.3.2 in [2].
            For the ACF of raw data, the standard error at a lag k is
            found as if the right model was an MA(k-1). This allows the
            possible interpretation that if all autocorrelations past a
            certain lag are within the limits, the model might be an MA of
            order defined by the last significant autocorrelation. In this
            case, a moving average model is assumed for the data and the
            standard errors for the confidence intervals should be
            generated using Bartlett's formula. For more details on
            Bartlett formula result, see section 7.2 in [1].+
        acf_kwargs : dict, optional
