    State space initialization

    Parameters
    ----------
    k_states : int
    exact_diffuse_initialization : bool, optional
        Whether or not to use exact diffuse initialization; only has an effect
        if some states are initialized as diffuse. Default is True.
    approximate_diffuse_variance : float, optional
        If using approximate diffuse initialization, the initial variance used.
        Default is 1e6.

    Notes
    -----
    As developed in Durbin and Koopman (2012), the state space recursions
    must be initialized for the first time period. The general form of this
    initialization is:

    .. math::

        \alpha_1 & = a + A \delta + R_0 \eta_0 \\
        \delta & \sim N(0, \kappa I), \kappa \to \infty \\
        \eta_0 & \sim N(0, Q_0)

    Thus the state vector can be initialized with a known constant part
    (elements of :math:`a`), with part modeled as a diffuse initial
    distribution (as a part of :math:`\delta`), and with a part modeled as a
    known (proper) initial distribution (as a part of :math:`\eta_0`).

    There are two important restrictions:

    1. An element of the state vector initialized as diffuse cannot be also
       modeled with a stationary component. In the `validate` method,
       violations of this cause an exception to be raised.
    2. If an element of the state vector is initialized with both a known
       constant part and with a diffuse initial distribution, the effect of
       the diffuse initialization will essentially ignore the given known
       constant value. In the `validate` method, violations of this cause a
       warning to be given, since it is not technically invalid but may
       indicate user error.

    The :math:`\eta_0` compoenent is also referred to as the stationary part
    because it is often set to the unconditional distribution of a stationary
    process.

    Initialization is specified for blocks (consecutive only, for now) of the
    state vector, with the entire state vector and individual elements as
    special cases. Denote the block in question as :math:`\alpha_1^{(i)}`. It
    can be initialized in the following ways:

    - 'known'
    - 'diffuse' or 'exact_diffuse' or 'approximate_diffuse'
    - 'stationary'
    - 'mixed'

    In the first three cases, the block's initialization is specified as an
    instance of the `Initialization` class, with the `initialization_type`
    attribute set to one of those three string values. In the 'mixed' cases,
    the initialization is also an instance of the `Initialization` class, but
    it will itself contain sub-blocks. Details of each type follow.

    Regardless of the type, for each block, the following must be defined:
    the `constant` array, an array `diffuse` with indices corresponding to
    diffuse elements, an array `stationary` with indices corresponding to
    stationary elements, and `stationary_cov`, a matrix with order equal to the
    number of stationary elements in the block.

    **Known**

    If a block is initialized as known, then a known (possibly degenerate)
    distribution is used; in particular, the block of states is understood to
    be distributed
    :math:`\alpha_1^{(i)} \sim N(a^{(i)}, Q_0^{(i)})`. Here, is is possible to
    set :math:`a^{(i)} = 0`, and it is also possible that
    :math:`Q_0^{(i)}` is only positive-semidefinite; i.e.
    :math:`\alpha_1^{(i)}` may be degenerate. One particular example is
    that if the entire block's initial values are known, then
    :math:`R_0^{(i)} = 0`, and so `Var(\alpha_1^{(i)}) = 0`.

    Here, `constant` must be provided (although it can be zeros), and
    `stationary_cov` is optional (by default it is a matrix of zeros).

    **Diffuse**

    If a block is initialized as diffuse, then set
    :math:`\alpha_1^{(i)} \sim N(a^{(i)}, \kappa^{(i)} I)`. If the block is
    initialized using the exact diffuse initialization procedure, then it is
    understood that :math:`\kappa^{(i)} \to \infty`.

    If the block is initialized using the approximate diffuse initialization
    procedure, then `\kappa^{(i)}` is set to some large value rather than
    driven to infinity.

    In the approximate diffuse initialization case, it is possible, although
    unlikely, that a known constant value may have some effect on
    initialization if :math:`\kappa^{(i)}` is not set large enough.

    Here, `constant` may be provided, and `approximate_diffuse_variance` may be
    provided.

    **Stationary**

    If a block is initialized as stationary, then the block of states is
    understood to have the distribution
    :math:`\alpha_1^{(i)} \sim N(a^{(i)}, Q_0^{(i)})`. :math:`a^{(i)}` is
    the unconditional mean of the block, computed as
    :math:`(I - T^{(i)})^{-1} c_t`. :math:`Q_0^{(i)}` is the unconditional
    variance of the block, computed as the solution to the discrete Lyapunov
    equation:

    .. math::

        T^{(i)} Q_0^{(i)} T^{(i)} + (R Q R')^{(i)} = Q_0^{(i)}

    :math:`T^{(i)}` and :math:`(R Q R')^{(i)}` are the submatrices of
    the corresponding state space system matrices corresponding to the given
    block of states.

    Here, no values can be provided.

    **Mixed**

    In this case, the block can be further broken down into sub-blocks.
    Usually, only the top-level `Initialization` instance will be of 'mixed'
    type, and in many cases, even the top-level instance will be purely
    'known', 'diffuse', or 'stationary'.

    For a block of type mixed, suppose that it has `J` sub-blocks,
    :math:`\alpha_1^{(i,j)}`. Then
    :math:`\alpha_1^{(i)} = a^{(i)} + A^{(i)} \delta + R_0^{(i)} \eta_0^{(i)}`.

    Examples
    --------

    Basic examples have one specification for all of the states:

    >>> Initialization(k_states=2, 'known', constant=[0, 1])
    >>> Initialization(k_states=2, 'known', stationary_cov=np.eye(2))
    >>> Initialization(k_states=2, 'known', constant=[0, 1],
                       stationary_cov=np.eye(2))
    >>> Initialization(k_states=2, 'diffuse')
    >>> Initialization(k_states=2, 'approximate_diffuse',
                       approximate_diffuse_variance=1e6)
    >>> Initialization(k_states=2, 'stationary')

    More complex examples initialize different blocks of states separately

    >>> init = Initialization(k_states=3)
    >>> init.set((0, 1), 'known', constant=[0, 1])
    >>> init.set((0, 1), 'known', stationary_cov=np.eye(2))
    >>> init.set((0, 1), 'known', constant=[0, 1],
                 stationary_cov=np.eye(2))
    >>> init.set((0, 1), 'diffuse')
    >>> init.set((0, 1), 'approximate_diffuse',
                 approximate_diffuse_variance=1e6)
    >>> init.set((0, 1), 'stationary')

    A still more complex example initializes a block using a previously
    created `Initialization` object:

    >>> init1 = Initialization(k_states=2, 'known', constant=[0, 1])
    >>> init2 = Initialization(k_states=3)
    >>> init2.set((1, 2), init1)

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : array_like, optional
            Vector of constant values describing the mean of the stationary
            component of the initial state.
        Pstar : array_like, optional
            Stationary component of the initial state covariance matrix. If
            given, should be a matrix shaped `k_states x k_states`. The

            Note that by definition, `Pstar = R0 @ Q0 @ R0.T`, so either

        Pinf : array_like, optional
            Diffuse component of the initial state covariance matrix. If given,
            should be a matrix shaped `k_states x k_states` with ones in the
            diagonal positions corresponding to states with diffuse
            initialization and zeros otherwise. Note that by definition,

        A : array_like, optional
            Diffuse selection matrix, used in the definition of the diffuse
            initial state covariance matrix. If given, should be a

            `k_states x k_nondiffuse_states` matrix that contains the subset of
            the columns of the identity matrix that correspond to states with a
            non-diffuse initialization. Note that by definition,
            `Pstar = R0 @ Q0 @ R0.T`, so either `R0,Q0` or `Pstar` may be
            given, but not both.
        Q0 : array_like, optional
            Covariance matrix associated with stationary initial states. If
            given, should be a matrix shaped
