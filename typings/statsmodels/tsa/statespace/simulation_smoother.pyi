    simulation_smooth_results_class : class, optional

        Parameters
        ----------
        simulation_output : int, optional
            Determines which simulation smoother output is calculated.
            Default is all (including state and disturbances).
        method : {'kfs', 'cfa'}, optional
            Method for simulation smoothing. If `method='kfs'`, then the
            simulation smoother is based on Kalman filtering and smoothing
            recursions. If `method='cfa'`, then the simulation smoother is
            based on the Cholesky Factor Algorithm (CFA) approach. The CFA
            approach is not applicable to all state space models, but can be
            faster for the cases in which it is supported.
        results_class : class, optional

            class must extend from `SimulationSmoothResults`.
        prefix : str
            The prefix of the datatype. Usually only used internally.
        nobs : int
            The number of observations to simulate. If set to anything other
            than -1, only simulation will be performed (i.e. simulation
            smoothing will not be performed), so that only the `generated_obs`
            and `generated_state` attributes will be available.
        random_state : {None, int, Generator, RandomState}, optional
            If `seed` is None (or `np.random`), the `numpy.random.RandomState`
            singleton is used.
            If `seed` is an int, a new ``numpy.random.RandomState`` instance

        Parameters
        ----------
        simulation_output : int, optional
            Bitmask controlling simulation output. Default is to use the
            simulation output defined in object initialization.
        measurement_disturbance_variates : array_like, optional
            If specified, these are the shocks to the measurement equation,
            :math:`\varepsilon_t`. If unspecified, these are automatically
            generated using a pseudo-random number generator. If specified,
            must be shaped `nsimulations` x `k_endog`, where `k_endog` is the
            same as in the state space model.
        state_disturbance_variates : array_like, optional
            If specified, these are the shocks to the state equation,
            :math:`\eta_t`. If unspecified, these are automatically
            generated using a pseudo-random number generator. If specified,
            must be shaped `nsimulations` x `k_posdef` where `k_posdef` is the
            same as in the state space model.
        initial_state_variates : array_like, optional
            If specified, this is the state vector at time zero, which should
            be shaped (`k_states` x 1), where `k_states` is the same as in the
            state space model. If unspecified, but the model has been
            initialized, then that initialization is used.
        initial_state_variates : array_likes, optional
            Random values to use as initial state variates. Usually only
            specified if results are to be replicated (e.g. to enforce a seed)
            or for testing. If not specified, random variates are drawn.
        pretransformed_measurement_disturbance_variates : bool, optional
            If `measurement_disturbance_variates` is provided, this flag
            indicates whether it should be directly used as the shocks. If
            False, then it is assumed to contain draws from the standard Normal
            distribution that must be transformed using the `obs_cov`
            covariance matrix. Default is False.
        pretransformed_state_disturbance_variates : bool, optional
            If `state_disturbance_variates` is provided, this flag indicates
            whether it should be directly used as the shocks. If False, then it
            is assumed to contain draws from the standard Normal distribution
            that must be transformed using the `state_cov` covariance matrix.
            Default is False.
        pretransformed_initial_state_variates : bool, optional
            If `initial_state_variates` is provided, this flag indicates
            whether it should be directly used as the initial_state. If False,
            then it is assumed to contain draws from the standard Normal
            distribution that must be transformed using the `initial_state_cov`
            covariance matrix. Default is False.
        random_state : {None, int, Generator, RandomState}, optional
            If `seed` is None (or `np.random`), the `numpy.random.RandomState`
            singleton is used.
            If `seed` is an int, a new ``numpy.random.RandomState`` instance

            If `seed` is already a ``numpy.random.Generator`` or
