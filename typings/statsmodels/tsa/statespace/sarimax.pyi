class SARIMAX(MLEModel):
    r"""
    Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors
    model

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        The observed time-series process :math:`y`
    exog : array_like, optional
        Array of exogenous regressors, shaped nobs x k.
    order : iterable or iterable of iterables, optional
        The (p,d,q) order of the model for the number of AR parameters,
        differences, and MA parameters. `d` must be an integer
        indicating the integration order of the process, while
        `p` and `q` may either be an integers indicating the AR and MA
        orders (so that all lags up to those orders are included) or else
        iterables giving specific AR and / or MA lags to include. Default is
        an AR(1) model: (1,0,0).
    seasonal_order : iterable, optional
        The (P,D,Q,s) order of the seasonal component of the model for the
        AR parameters, differences, MA parameters, and periodicity.
        `D` must be an integer indicating the integration order of the process,
        while `P` and `Q` may either be an integers indicating the AR and MA
        orders (so that all lags up to those orders are included) or else
        iterables giving specific AR and / or MA lags to include. `s` is an
        integer giving the periodicity (number of periods in season), often it
        is 4 for quarterly data or 12 for monthly data. Default is no seasonal
        effect.
    trend : str{'n','c','t','ct'} or iterable, optional
        Parameter controlling the deterministic trend polynomial :math:`A(t)`.
        Can be specified as a string where 'c' indicates a constant (i.e. a
        degree zero component of the trend polynomial), 't' indicates a
        linear trend with time, and 'ct' is both. Can also be specified as an
        iterable defining the non-zero polynomial exponents to include, in
        increasing order. For example, `[1,1,0,1]` denotes
        :math:`a + bt + ct^3`. Default is to not include a trend component.
    measurement_error : bool, optional
        Whether or not to assume the endogenous observations `endog` were
        measured with error. Default is False.
    time_varying_regression : bool, optional
        Used when an explanatory variables, `exog`, are provided
        to select whether or not coefficients on the exogenous regressors are
        allowed to vary over time. Default is False.
    mle_regression : bool, optional
        Whether or not to use estimate the regression coefficients for the
        exogenous variables as part of maximum likelihood estimation or through
        the Kalman filter (i.e. recursive least squares). If
        `time_varying_regression` is True, this must be set to False. Default
        is True.
    simple_differencing : bool, optional
        Whether or not to use partially conditional maximum likelihood
        estimation. If True, differencing is performed prior to estimation,
        which discards the first :math:`s D + d` initial rows but results in a
        smaller state-space formulation. See the Notes section for important
        details about interpreting results when this option is used. If False,
        the full SARIMAX model is put in state-space form so that all
        datapoints can be used in estimation. Default is False.
    enforce_stationarity : bool, optional
        Whether or not to transform the AR parameters to enforce stationarity
        in the autoregressive component of the model. Default is True.
    enforce_invertibility : bool, optional
        Whether or not to transform the MA parameters to enforce invertibility
        in the moving average component of the model. Default is True.
    hamilton_representation : bool, optional
        Whether or not to use the Hamilton representation of an ARMA process
        (if True) or the Harvey representation (if False). Default is False.
    concentrate_scale : bool, optional
        Whether or not to concentrate the scale (variance of the error term)
        out of the likelihood. This reduces the number of parameters estimated
        by maximum likelihood by one, but standard errors will then not
        be available for the scale parameter.
    trend_offset : int, optional
        The offset at which to start time trend values. Default is 1, so that
        if `trend='t'` the trend is equal to 1, 2, ..., nobs. Typically is only
        set when the model created by extending a previous dataset.
    use_exact_diffuse : bool, optional
        Whether or not to use exact diffuse initialization for non-stationary
        states. Default is False (in which case approximate diffuse
        initialization is used).
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments may be used to provide default values for state space
        matrices or for Kalman filtering options. See `Representation`, and
        `KalmanFilter` for more details.

    Notes
    -----
    The SARIMA model is specified :math:`(p, d, q) \times (P, D, Q)_s`.

    .. math::

        \phi_p (L) \tilde \phi_P (L^s) \Delta^d \Delta_s^D y_t = A(t) +
            \theta_q (L) \tilde \theta_Q (L^s) \zeta_t

    In terms of a univariate structural model, this can be represented as

    .. math::

        y_t & = u_t + \eta_t \\
        \phi_p (L) \tilde \phi_P (L^s) \Delta^d \Delta_s^D u_t & = A(t) +
            \theta_q (L) \tilde \theta_Q (L^s) \zeta_t

    where :math:`\eta_t` is only applicable in the case of measurement error
    (although it is also used in the case of a pure regression model, i.e. if
    p=q=0).

    In terms of this model, regression with SARIMA errors can be represented
    easily as

    .. math::

        y_t & = \beta_t x_t + u_t \\
        \phi_p (L) \tilde \phi_P (L^s) \Delta^d \Delta_s^D u_t & = A(t) +
            \theta_q (L) \tilde \theta_Q (L^s) \zeta_t

    this model is the one used when exogenous regressors are provided.

    Note that the reduced form lag polynomials will be written as:

    .. math::

        \Phi (L) \equiv \phi_p (L) \tilde \phi_P (L^s) \\
        \Theta (L) \equiv \theta_q (L) \tilde \theta_Q (L^s)

    If `mle_regression` is True, regression coefficients are treated as
    additional parameters to be estimated via maximum likelihood. Otherwise
    they are included as part of the state with a diffuse initialization.
    In this case, however, with approximate diffuse initialization, results
    can be sensitive to the initial variance.

    This class allows two different underlying representations of ARMA models
    as state space models: that of Hamilton and that of Harvey. Both are
    equivalent in the sense that they are analytical representations of the
    ARMA model, but the state vectors of each have different meanings. For
    this reason, maximum likelihood does not result in identical parameter
    estimates and even the same set of parameters will result in different
    loglikelihoods.

    The Harvey representation is convenient because it allows integrating
    differencing into the state vector to allow using all observations for
    estimation.

    In this implementation of differenced models, the Hamilton representation
    is not able to accommodate differencing in the state vector, so
    `simple_differencing` (which performs differencing prior to estimation so
    that the first d + sD observations are lost) must be used.

    Many other packages use the Hamilton representation, so that tests against
    Stata and R require using it along with simple differencing (as Stata
    does).

    If `filter_concentrated = True` is used, then the scale of the model is
    concentrated out of the likelihood. A benefit of this is that there the
    dimension of the parameter vector is reduced so that numerical maximization
    of the log-likelihood function may be faster and more stable. If this
    option in a model with measurement error, it is important to note that the
    estimated measurement error parameter will be relative to the scale, and
    is named "snr.measurement_error" instead of "var.measurement_error". To
    compute the variance of the measurement error in this case one would
    multiply `snr.measurement_error` parameter by the scale.

    If `simple_differencing = True` is used, then the `endog` and `exog` data
    are differenced prior to putting the model in state-space form. This has
    the same effect as if the user differenced the data prior to constructing
    the model, which has implications for using the results:

    - Forecasts and predictions will be about the *differenced* data, not about
      the original data. (while if `simple_differencing = False` is used, then
      forecasts and predictions will be about the original data).
    - If the original data has an Int64Index, a new RangeIndex will be created
      for the differenced data that starts from one, and forecasts and
      predictions will use this new index.

    Detailed information about state space models can be found in [1]_. Some
    specific references are:

    - Chapter 3.4 describes ARMA and ARIMA models in state space form (using
      the Harvey representation), and gives references for basic seasonal
      models and models with a multiplicative form (for example the airline
      model). It also shows a state space model for a full ARIMA process (this
      is what is done here if `simple_differencing=False`).
    - Chapter 3.6 describes estimating regression effects via the Kalman filter
      (this is performed if `mle_regression` is False), regression with
      time-varying coefficients, and regression with ARMA errors (recall from
      above that if regression effects are present, the model estimated by this
      class is regression with SARIMA errors).
    - Chapter 8.4 describes the application of an ARMA model to an example
      dataset. A replication of this section is available in an example
      IPython notebook in the documentation.
