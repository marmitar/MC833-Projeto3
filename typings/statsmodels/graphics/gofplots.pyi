    Q-Q and P-P Probability Plots

    Can take arguments specifying the parameters for dist or fit them
    automatically. (See fit under kwargs.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like
        A 1d data array
    dist : callable
        Compare x against dist. A scipy.stats or statsmodels distribution. The
        default is scipy.stats.distributions.norm (a standard normal). Can be
        a SciPy frozen distribution.
    fit : bool
        If fit is false, loc, scale, and distargs are passed to the
        distribution. If fit is True then the parameters for dist are fit
        automatically using dist.fit. The quantiles are formed from the
        standardized data, after subtracting the fitted loc and dividing by
        the fitted scale. fit cannot be used if dist is a SciPy frozen
        distribution.
    distargs : tuple
        A tuple of arguments passed to dist to specify it fully so dist.ppf
        may be called. distargs must not contain loc or scale. These values
        must be passed using the loc or scale inputs. distargs cannot be used
        if dist is a SciPy frozen distribution.
    a : float
        Offset for the plotting position of an expected order statistic, for
        example. The plotting positions are given by
        (i - a)/(nobs - 2*a + 1) for i in range(0,nobs+1)
    loc : float
        Location parameter for dist. Cannot be used if dist is a SciPy frozen
        distribution.
    scale : float
        Scale parameter for dist. Cannot be used if dist is a SciPy frozen
        distribution.

    scipy.stats.probplot

    Notes
    -----
    1) Depends on matplotlib.
    2) If `fit` is True then the parameters are fit using the
        distribution's `fit()` method.
    3) The call signatures for the `qqplot`, `ppplot`, and `probplot`
        methods are similar, so examples 1 through 4 apply to all
        three methods.
    4) The three plotting methods are summarized below:
        ppplot : Probability-Probability plot
            Compares the sample and theoretical probabilities (percentiles).
        qqplot : Quantile-Quantile plot
            Compares the sample and theoretical quantiles
        probplot : Probability plot
            Same as a Q-Q plot, however probabilities are shown in the scale of
            the theoretical distribution (x-axis) and the y-axis contains
            unscaled quantiles of the sample data.

    Examples
    --------
    The first example shows a Q-Q plot for regression residuals

    >>> # example 1
    >>> import statsmodels.api as sm
    >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    >>> data = sm.datasets.longley.load()
    >>> data.exog = sm.add_constant(data.exog)
    >>> model = sm.OLS(data.endog, data.exog)
    >>> mod_fit = model.fit()
    >>> res = mod_fit.resid # residuals
    >>> pplot = sm.ProbPlot(res)
    >>> fig = pplot.qqplot()
    >>> h = plt.title("Ex. 1 - qqplot - residuals of OLS fit")
    >>> plt.show()

    qqplot of the residuals against quantiles of t-distribution with 4
    degrees of freedom:

    >>> # example 2
    >>> import scipy.stats as stats
    >>> pplot = sm.ProbPlot(res, stats.t, distargs=(4,))
    >>> fig = pplot.qqplot()
    >>> h = plt.title("Ex. 2 - qqplot - residuals against quantiles of t-dist")
    >>> plt.show()

    qqplot against same as above, but with mean 3 and std 10:

    >>> # example 3
    >>> pplot = sm.ProbPlot(res, stats.t, distargs=(4,), loc=3, scale=10)
    >>> fig = pplot.qqplot()
    >>> h = plt.title("Ex. 3 - qqplot - resids vs quantiles of t-dist")
    >>> plt.show()

    Automatically determine parameters for t distribution including the
    loc and scale:

    >>> # example 4
    >>> pplot = sm.ProbPlot(res, stats.t, fit=True)
    >>> fig = pplot.qqplot(line="45")
    >>> h = plt.title("Ex. 4 - qqplot - resids vs. quantiles of fitted t-dist")
    >>> plt.show()

    A second `ProbPlot` object can be used to compare two separate sample
    sets by using the `other` kwarg in the `qqplot` and `ppplot` methods.

    >>> # example 5
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.random.normal(loc=8.25, scale=2.75, size=37)
    >>> y = np.random.normal(loc=8.75, scale=3.25, size=37)
    >>> pp_x = sm.ProbPlot(x, fit=True)
    >>> pp_y = sm.ProbPlot(y, fit=True)
    >>> fig = pp_x.qqplot(line="45", other=pp_y)
    >>> h = plt.title("Ex. 5 - qqplot - compare two sample sets")
    >>> plt.show()

    In qqplot, sample size of `other` can be equal or larger than the first.
    In case of larger, size of `other` samples will be reduced to match the
    size of the first by interpolation

    >>> # example 6
    >>> x = np.random.normal(loc=8.25, scale=2.75, size=37)
    >>> y = np.random.normal(loc=8.75, scale=3.25, size=57)
    >>> pp_x = sm.ProbPlot(x, fit=True)
    >>> pp_y = sm.ProbPlot(y, fit=True)
    >>> fig = pp_x.qqplot(line="45", other=pp_y)
    >>> title = "Ex. 6 - qqplot - compare different sample sizes"
    >>> h = plt.title(title)
    >>> plt.show()

    In ppplot, sample size of `other` and the first can be different. `other`
    will be used to estimate an empirical cumulative distribution function
    (ECDF). ECDF(x) will be plotted against p(x)=0.5/n, 1.5/n, ..., (n-0.5)/n
    where x are sorted samples from the first.

    >>> # example 7
    >>> x = np.random.normal(loc=8.25, scale=2.75, size=37)
    >>> y = np.random.normal(loc=8.75, scale=3.25, size=57)
    >>> pp_x = sm.ProbPlot(x, fit=True)
    >>> pp_y = sm.ProbPlot(y, fit=True)
    >>> pp_y.ppplot(line="45", other=pp_x)
    >>> plt.title("Ex. 7A- ppplot - compare two sample sets, other=pp_x")
    >>> pp_x.ppplot(line="45", other=pp_y)
    >>> plt.title("Ex. 7B- ppplot - compare two sample sets, other=pp_y")
    >>> plt.show()

        Y data for plot. Not needed if line is "45".
    dist : scipy.stats.distribution
        A scipy.stats distribution, needed if line is "q".
    fmt : str, optional
        Line format string passed to `plot`.
    **lineoptions
        Additional arguments to be passed to the `plot` command.

    Notes
    -----
    There is no return value. The line is plotted on the given `ax`.

    Examples
    --------
    Import the food expenditure dataset.  Plot annual food expenditure on x-axis
    and household income on y-axis.  Use qqline to add regression line into the
    plot.

    >>> import statsmodels.api as sm
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from statsmodels.graphics.gofplots import qqline

    >>> foodexp = sm.datasets.engel.load()
    >>> x = foodexp.exog
    >>> y = foodexp.endog
    >>> ax = plt.subplot(111)
    >>> plt.scatter(x, y)
    >>> ax.set_xlabel(foodexp.exog_name[0])
    >>> ax.set_ylabel(foodexp.endog_name)
    >>> qqline(ax, "r", x, y)
    >>> plt.show()

def plotting_pos(nobs, a=..., b=...):
    """
    Generates sequence of plotting positions

    Parameters
    ----------
    nobs : int
        Number of probability points to plot
    a : float, default 0.0
        alpha parameter for the plotting position of an expected order
        statistic
    b : float, default None
        beta parameter for the plotting position of an expected order
        statistic. If None, then b is set to a.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The plotting positions

    Notes
    -----
    The plotting positions are given by (i - a)/(nobs + 1 - a - b) for i in
    range(1, nobs+1)
