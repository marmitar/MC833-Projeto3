    Returns endog, exog, and the model specification from arrays and formula.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Y : array_like
        Either endog (the LHS) of a model specification or all of the data.
        Y must define __getitem__ for now.
    X : array_like
        Either exog or None. If all the data for the formula is provided in
        Y then you must explicitly set X to None.
    formula : str or patsy.model_desc
        You can pass a handler by import formula_handler and adding a
        key-value pair where the key is the formula object class and
        the value is a function that returns endog, exog, formula object.

    Returns
    -------
    endog : array_like
        Should preserve the input type of Y,X.
    exog : array_like
        Should preserve the input type of Y,X. Could be None.
