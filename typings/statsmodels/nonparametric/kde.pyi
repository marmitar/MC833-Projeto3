    Univariate Kernel Density Estimator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array_like
        The variable for which the density estimate is desired.

    Notes
    -----
    If cdf, sf, cumhazard, or entropy are computed, they are computed based on
    the definition of the kernel rather than the FFT approximation, even if
    the density is fit with FFT = True.

    `KDEUnivariate` is much faster than `KDEMultivariate`, due to its FFT-based
    implementation.  It should be preferred for univariate, continuous data.
    `KDEMultivariate` also supports mixed data.

        Attach the density estimate to the KDEUnivariate class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kernel : str
            The Kernel to be used. Choices are:

            - "biw" for biweight
            - "cos" for cosine
            - "epa" for Epanechnikov
            - "gau" for Gaussian.
            - "tri" for triangular
            - "triw" for triweight
            - "uni" for uniform

        bw : str, float, callable
            The bandwidth to use. Choices are:

            - "scott" - 1.059 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is
              `min(std(x),IQR/1.34)`
            - "silverman" - .9 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is
              `min(std(x),IQR/1.34)`
            - "normal_reference" - C * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where C is
              calculated from the kernel. Equivalent (up to 2 dp) to the
              "scott" bandwidth for gaussian kernels. See bandwidths.py
            - If a float is given, its value is used as the bandwidth.
            - If a callable is given, it's return value is used.
              The callable should take exactly two parameters, i.e.,
              fn(x, kern), and return a float, where:

              * x - the clipped input data
              * kern - the kernel instance used

        fft : bool
            Whether or not to use FFT. FFT implementation is more
            computationally efficient. However, only the Gaussian kernel
            is implemented. If FFT is False, then a 'nobs' x 'gridsize'
            intermediate array is created.
        gridsize : int
            If gridsize is None, max(len(x), 50) is used.
        cut : float
            Defines the length of the grid past the lowest and highest values
            of x so that the kernel goes to zero. The end points are
            ``min(x) - cut * adjust * bw`` and ``max(x) + cut * adjust * bw``.
        adjust : float
            An adjustment factor for the bw. Bandwidth becomes bw * adjust.

        Returns

        - If a float is given, its value is used as the bandwidth.
        - If a callable is given, it's return value is used.
          The callable should take exactly two parameters, i.e.,

    weights : array or None
        WEIGHTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED.
        Optional  weights. If the x value is clipped, then this weight is
        also dropped.
    gridsize : int
        If gridsize is None, min(len(x), 512) is used. Note that the provided
        number is rounded up to the next highest power of 2.
    adjust : float
        An adjustment factor for the bw. Bandwidth becomes bw * adjust.

    -------
    density : ndarray
        The densities estimated at the grid points.
    grid : ndarray, optional
        The grid points at which the density is estimated.

    Notes
    -----
    Only the default kernel is implemented. Weights are not implemented yet.
    This follows Silverman (1982) with changes suggested by Jones and Lotwick
    (1984). However, the discretization step is replaced by linear binning
    of Fan and Marron (1994). This should be extended to accept the parts
    that are dependent only on the data to speed things up for
    cross-validation.
